# Benplusplus

A new horizon of revolutionary programming languages is upon us. Don't be benhind the curve, be benhead of it.

## Usage

`mix execute <--code "Code" | --file "src.ben"> <--cout | --ofile "riscv.bin">`

Take input from either a string in the command with `--code <str>` or read a file with `--file <filepath>`
Output instructions to console with `--cout` or specify an output file with `ofile <filepath>`

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `benplusplus` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:benplusplus, "~> 0.1.0"}
